## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


Each directory and file is designed to facilitate the organization, execution, and analysis of the research process.

## Research Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Model Training**: Developing machine learning models to predict cancer outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using various metrics.
- **Result Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the model performance and findings.
